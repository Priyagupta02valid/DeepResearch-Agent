 
# 🧠 Deep Research Agent

Deep Research Agent is an AI-powered autonomous research assistant designed to explore complex topics, analyze information, and generate structured research outputs using large language models (LLMs).

It simulates a research workflow by breaking down queries, gathering insights, reasoning step-by-step, and producing well-structured responses — making it useful for students, developers, and researchers.
